Testing Codelab
============================================================================


Introduction
------------

TO-DO Notes is an app where you to write down tasks to complete. The app displays them in a list.
You can then mark them as completed or not, filter them and delete them.

The demonstrated techniques include:
- unit, integration and end-to-end testing
- usage of the androidX testing libraries
- test doubles, fakes and dependency injections
- mockito for creating mocks
- espresso for UI testing and idling resources
- testing LiveData, ViewModels, Fragments, navigation components, coroutines, Room and data binding


The used codelabs are:
* [Testing Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics)
* [Introduction to Test Doubles and Dependency Injection](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-test-doubles)
* [Survey of Testing Topics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-survey)


Pre-requisites
--------------

You should be familiar with:

* The Kotlin programming language, including [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) and their interaction with [Android Jetpack components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines).
* The following core Android Jetpack libraries: [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
 [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata),
  [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) and 
  [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).
* Application architecture, following the pattern from the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and [Android Fundamentals codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/toc).
